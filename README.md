Blood Bank Management System

My Blood Bank website provides a seamless platform to connect donors with recipients in need of life-saving blood transfusions. The system allows donors to register, manage their profiles, and view donation history. Recipients can easily search for available blood types based on their medical needs and request donations directly through the platform.

Key features include:
Real-time Blood Availability Information: View the current stock of available blood types across different categories (A, B, AB, O, etc.).
Donor Registration and Management: Donors can sign up, update personal information, and track their donation history.
Recipient Search: Recipients can search for specific blood types, submit requests, and view detailed blood bank inventory data.
Secure Data Handling: Ensures secure and confidential management of donor and recipient information.
My platform bridges the gap between donors and recipients, ensuring timely and reliable access to blood supplies, potentially saving lives with each donation.
